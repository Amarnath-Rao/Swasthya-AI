### Features
* Conversational Engagement: Engages users in meaningful conversations to understand their unique mental health needs.
* Resource Provision: Provides a variety of resources, including coping strategies, relaxation techniques, and links to relevant mental health materials.
* Tailored Support: Utilizes sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and data analytics to tailor support to each individual, enhancing effectiveness.
* Text-to-Speech Communication: Enables the chatbot to audibly communicate with users for an enhanced user experience.

### How to Use

#### Phase 1: Running the ML Model

1. Import Libraries: Ensure you have the required libraries for natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine learning. Install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
2. Initialize Text-to-Speech Engine: Set up the text-to-speech engine using pyttsx3 with voice selection.
3. Load Intent Data: Load intent data from the intents.json file for training the chatbot.
4. Prepare Training Data: Process intent data to create training and output sets for the neural network.
5. Define Neural Network Model: Design a neural network model using tflearn with input, hidden, and output layers.
6. Train the Model: Train the model on the prepared data, adjusting parameters for optimal performance.
7. Implement Bag of Words: Create a function to convert sentences into a "bag of words" representation.
8. Facilitate Conversation: Develop a chat() function for user interaction with the trained chatbot.

#### In short Run the ML model and run main.py 

#### Phase 2: Automated Support using Gemini Pro AI

Create Gemini Pro AI API key: Follow the instructions to install Gemini Pro AI, a powerful tool for automated mental health support.
Run the Folder: Execute the files to initiate the chatbot and provide users with automated mental health assistance.
